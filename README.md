# A sentiment comparison program sing NLP (Natural Language Processing) and the Twitter API 

##  How does the program work?

1. First, a user will input two keywords, e.g. Batman and Superman.

2. We will then download the latest, real-time tweets relating to those two keywords using the Twitter API.  

3. Next, we will use the TextBlob library for calculating the tweets' sentiments (NLP part). This tells us how people feel about our specified keywords at this moment in time! 

4. Lastly, the program compares the scores of the two keywords and tells us what thing people feel more positively about right now
